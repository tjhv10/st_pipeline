Active Object Prime Number
Description:
This project demonstrates the concept of active objects and showcases the calculation and processing of prime numbers using a multi-threaded approach.

Features:

Generates a specified number of random integers
Checks if a number is prime
Performs subtraction and addition operations
Prints the results of each operation
Utilizes active objects for concurrent processing
Implements a task queue for managing tasks
Supports command-line arguments for specifying the number of integers and seed value
Prerequisites:

C++ compiler
CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
Getting Started:

Repository URL: https://github.com/tjhv10/st_pipeline.git
Build the project using CMake:

Navigate to the project directory: st_pipeline
Create a build directory: mkdir build
Enter the build directory: cd build
Generate build files: cmake ..
Build the project: make
Run the program with the desired command-line arguments:

Command: ./st_pipeline <N> [<seed>]
Replace <N> with the desired number of random integers to generate and process.
Replace <seed> (optional) with the seed value for the random number generator. If not provided, a random seed will be used.
